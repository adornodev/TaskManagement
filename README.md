# TaskManagement

The batch script called "TaskManagement" allows you to import and export Tasks from the Windows system in an automated way.

## How to use?


The script must receive **two input arguments**.
The first one is whether you want to export or import tasks. 

To import, type "import" as the first argument. Otherwise, type "export".

The second argument must receive the directory used to save or read the tasks.

Example: TaskManagement.bat import C:\Users\Me\TasksManagement\Backup\
